# Reliability guardrails (Manim agent work)

- Prefer **structured scene representations** (app schema / ops) over raw Manim Python.
- If generating Python, use a **fixed template** and minimal imports; avoid arbitrary file/network actions.
- Treat GitHub code as **untrusted** until it:
  - passes license checks
  - is rewritten/normalized
  - renders successfully in our environment
- Use **patch-only** fixes after failures; avoid full rewrites unless necessary.
- Always maintain a “last known good” version; never destroy working output during repairs.
